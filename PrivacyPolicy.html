                <h4>LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTERESTS</h4>
                <p>
                We may use and process Your data for Our legitimate business interests, which include, among other
                things, communicating with You, improving Our goods or services, improving Our website, and providing
                You with the information or products that You have requested.</p>


                <p>
                <strong>Performance of a Contract:</strong>  We may use and process Your information to enter into a contract with You and
                to perform Our contractual obligations to You.</p>


                <p>
                <strong>Consent:</strong> We may use Your data, or permit selected third parties to use Your data, based on Your consent
                to Our use and sharing of that data. You may withdraw Your consent at any time, but doing so may affect

                <strong>As required by law:</strong> We may also use or process Your data as required for Us to comply with legal
                obligations.</p>



                <h4>WHY WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
                <p>
                We may share Your information with third parties in certain situations. In particular, We may share Your
                data with third-party processors as needed to serve Our legitimate business interests, which include
                administration of Our website, administration of Your account, entering into contracts with You,
                communicating with You, taking orders for goods or services, delivering Our goods and services,
                identifying trends, protecting the security of Our company and website, and marketing additional goods
                and services to You. The legal basis for Our disclosure of Your data is both Your Consent to this
                Privacy Policy and Our own right to protect and promote Our legitimate business interests.</p>


                
                <p>The following are specific reasons why We may share Your information:</p>


                <p>
                Third Party Processing: We may disclose Your information to third parties who assist Us with various
                tasks, including payment processing, hosting services, email delivery, communications, and customer
                service. We may not always disclose these third-party processors if not required by law. We do not
                authorize them to use or disclose Your personal information except in connection with providing Our
                company with their services.</p>


                <p>
                <strong>By Law:</strong> We may share Your data as required by law or to respond to legal process, including a subpoena,
                or as necessary to protect the rights, property, and safety of others. This includes sharing information
                with other parties to prevent or address fraud and to avoid credit risks.</p>


                <p>
                To Protect Our Company: We may use Your information to protect Our company, including to investigate and
                remedy any violations of Our rights or policies. We may also disclose Your information as reasonably
                necessary to acquire and maintain insurance coverage, manage risks, obtain financial or legal advice, or
                to exercise or defend against legal claims.</p>


                <p>
                Business Transfers: In the unlikely event Our company engages in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy
                proceedings, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding, We may transfer or share
                Your data as part of that proceeding. In such transitions, customer information is one of the business
                assets that is acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such business transfers may occur and
                that Your personal information can continue to be stored, used, or processed as otherwise set forth in
                this privacy policy.</p>


                <p>
                Interaction With Others: If You interact with others on Our website or mobile app, such as participating
                in a group chat or a group online course, other users may have access to some of Your data, including
                Your name, profile picture, and Your history of interaction with Our website, such as prior comments or
                posts.</p>


                <p>
                Online Postings: When You post online, Your posts may be viewed by others, and We may distribute Your
                comments outside the website.</p>


                <p>
                External Links: Our website may include hyperlinks to other websites not controlled by Us. We suggest
                You exercise caution when clicking on a hyperlink. Although We use reasonable care in including a
                hyperlink on Our own web page, We do not regularly monitor the websites of these third parties and are
                not responsible for any damage or consequences You suffer by using these hyperlinks. We are not bound by
                the Privacy Policies of any third-party website that You access by a hyperlink, nor are they bound by
                ours. We encourage You to read the Policies of those third-party websites before interacting with them
                or making purchases. They may collect different information and by different methods than We do.</p>


                <p>
                Other Purposes: We may disclose Your personal data as necessary to comply with any legal obligation or
                to protect Your interests, or the vital interests of others or Our company.</p>



                <h4>TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
                <p>
                Log Files: Like many other websites, We make use of log files. These files merely log visitors to the
                site – usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services’ analytics. The
                information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet
                Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This
                information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement around the site, and
                gather demographic information. IP addresses and other such information are not linked to any
                information that is personally identifiable.</p>


                <p>

                For the most part, We do not process Your information in-house, but give it to third-party processors
                for processing. For example, when PayPal takes Your payment information, they are a third-party
                processor. They process Your payment and remit the funds to Us. So in many instances, it will be
                necessary for Us to transmit Your information to a third-party processor, as We do not have the
                capability to perform these functions. More detail on third-party processing is detailed below.</p>


                <p>
                However, We may, from time to time, process Your data internally. The legal basis for this processing is
                both Your consent to the processing, Our need to conduct Our legitimate business interests, and to

                maintain, and improve Our website and offerings, to enter into contracts with You, to fulfill the terms
                of those contracts, to keep records of Our transactions and interactions, to be able to provide You with
                goods and services, to comply with Our legal obligations, to obtain professional advice, and to protect
                the rights and interests of Our company, Our customers (including You), and any third parties. We may
                process the following data:</p>

                </ul>
                

                <h4>DATA RETENTION</h4>
                <p>
                We retain personal data as long as it is needed to to conduct Our legitimate business purposes or to
                comply with Our legal obligations, or until You ask Us to delete Your data. For example, We will retain
                certain personal information indefinitely for the purposes of maintaining Your account, unless and until
                You delete Your account. Data that We gather for a specific and particular purpose, such as assisting
                law enforcement or analyzing trends, will be kept for no longer than is necessary for that particular
                purpose. Data that is no longer needed by Us for any of the purposes listed above will be permanently

                companies for the purpose of analyzing the use of Our website) as needed for internal analysis purposes.
                This type of data is usually retained for a shorter period of time than personal data, unless the data
                is necessary to improve the security or functionality of Our website or offerings, or We are legally
                obligated to retain the data for a longer period of time.</p>

                <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                    <li>reading or following information instructions and procedures for using or utilizing goods and/or
                        services, for security and safety;</li>
                    <li>in good faith in conducting transactions for the purchase of goods and/or services;</li>
                    <li>pay according to the agreed exchange rate;</li>
                    <li>follow efforts to settle legal disputes on consumer protection properly.</li>
                </ul>


                <p>
                Consumer rights are not only regulated in national regulations, but also regulated under international
                law. John F. Kennedy stated that there are at least 4 (four) consumer rights that must be protected,
                consisting of:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The right to safety, or the right to obtain security. This right is intended to protect consumers
                        from the marketing of goods and/or services that endanger consumer safety. Government intervention and
                        responsibility in the context of ensuring consumer safety is very important, therefore consumer
                        regulations are urgently needed to protect consumers from producer behavior that can harm consumer
                        safety.</li>
                    <li>The right to vote, namely the right to vote. For consumers, the right to choose is the consumer's
                        prerogative, namely whether he will buy or not buy the goods and/or services.</li>
                    <li>The right to obtain information, namely the right to obtain information. In this case, information
                        regarding the goods to be purchased by consumers must be complete and honest, so as not to reach
                        consumers.</li>
                    <li>The right to be heard, or the right to be heard. This right is to guarantee that consumers must be
                        considered in government circles, including the part that is heard in its formation. Apart from that,
                        producers must also hear complaints and expectations from consumers.</li>
                </ul>
